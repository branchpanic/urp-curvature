# urp-curvature
Screen space curvature feature for URP

## Attribution
- CurvatureFeature is a lean version of DrawFullscreenFeature from Unity's [Universal Rendering Examples][ure]
- Curvature shader is based on Bartek Moniewski's [Blender Feature request][blender]
- Inspiration came from MalyaWka's WIP [ScreenSpaceCavity package][original], which I couldn't get working in the latest Unity/URP
